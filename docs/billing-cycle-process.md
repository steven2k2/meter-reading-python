# Meter Reading Process and Glossary

## Meter Reading Process

Meter reading for utility billing involves systematic collection of consumption data to ensure accurate customer billing. Meter readers follow structured routines to cover assigned areas efficiently.

### Reading Workflow

1. **Book Selection**:
    - At the beginning of each billing cycle, meter readers select a "book," representing a set of meters to be read.
    - Books usually represent distinct geographic or logical groupings, such as suburbs, subdivisions, or industrial areas.

2. **Route Planning**:
    - Meter readers plan an optimal route based on the sequence provided, commonly reading up one side of a street and then returning along the opposite side (odd and even house numbers).

3. **Data Collection**:
    - Readers record meter readings manually or via handheld devices.
    - Special conditions or notes about accessibility (e.g., locked gates, dogs, restricted access) are documented.

4. **Review and Submission**:
    - Collected data is reviewed for completeness and accuracy.
    - Data is submitted for processing and billing.

| Term                     | Description                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Book**                 | A group of meters assigned for sequential reading within a billing cycle, usually geographically organised.                              |
| **Billing Cycle**        | Regular time period (e.g., monthly, quarterly) for recording meter consumption data and billing customers.                               |
| **Meter Reader**         | Person responsible for physically inspecting and recording consumption from utility meters.                                              |
| **Sequential Reading**   | The systematic approach to reading meters, often based on house numbers (e.g., odd numbers first, then evens).                           |
| **Meter Data**           | Data collected from meters including usage readings and related customer and meter details.                                              |
| **Handheld Device**      | Portable device used by meter readers to electronically record and submit readings.                                                      |
| **LPF (Line-per-field)** | Data format commonly used by legacy systems (e.g., COBOL) to store and process meter readings.                                           |
| **Accessibility Notes**  | Important observations about difficulties or hazards encountered during meter reading activities (e.g., dog warnings, security systems). |
| **Odd/Even Sequence**    | Reading meters by covering one side of a street first (odd-numbered houses), then returning via the other side (even-numbered houses).   |

### Key Considerations
- Accurate documentation is essential to prevent billing discrepancies.
- Efficient route planning saves time and resources.
- Clear record-keeping helps in managing customer queries and potential disputes.
